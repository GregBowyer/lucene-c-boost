add a "requireExactTotalHits" boolean

CSQ(TermQuery) can be massively optimized in the no deletes case!

hmm will this "starve" GC?

must null check every getXXXArray

costantScore(TQ/BQ)

how to work across diff't lucene versions!?

make separate NativeMMapII impls for bounds checking (segments_N) and not?

really we should do the "checking" for all segs up-front, so we don't e.g. do lots of work on first segments only to discover a bad PF in the last one
  - or, do the native or not decision per-segment ... but this is uncommon

add madvise calls for merges to NativeMMapDir?

facets?

filter rewrite method

factor out common code in NativeSearch.java

why are there score iota diffs!

gen specialized decoders for x86!!!  horrible that I bswap on every load...

don't specialize decode above 24 bits?

write simd?

also BQ and?

also BQ not terms?

allow terms across different fields

allow omit norms?

make good random test

should i make just one JNI call, passing all segments down?  or, one JNI call per segment?

should we pre-share global stuff like byte[] norms?
