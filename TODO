how to work across diff't lucene versions!?

need NativeMMapDir.createSlicer

add madvise calls for merges to NativeMMapDir?

facets?

filter rewrite method

somehow run all tests where searches go through the booster

factor out common code in NativeSearch.java

why are there score iota diffs!

gen specialized decoders for x86!!!  horrible that I bswap on every load...

don't specialize decode above 24 bits?

write simd?

also BQ and?

also BQ not terms?

allow terms across different fields

allow omit norms?

test CFS and non-CFS

make good random test

should i make just one JNI call, passing all segments down?  or, one JNI call per segment?

should we pre-share global stuff like byte[] norms?

NOTE
  - no safety!  index corruption / bugs = SEGV
